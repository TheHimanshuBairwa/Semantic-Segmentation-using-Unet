# U-Net Image Segmentation Using Keras

Image segmentation is a computer vision task that segments an image into multiple areas by assigning a label to every pixel of the image. It provides much more information about an image than object detection, which draws a bounding box around the detected object, or image classification, which assigns a label to the object.

# Data Set

The Oxford-IIIT pet dataset, available as part of the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS). It can be easily loaded with TFDS, and then with a bit of data preprocessing, ready for training segmentation models.
